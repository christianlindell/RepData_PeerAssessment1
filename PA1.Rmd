## The mean total number of steps taken per day


The mean steps per day with missing values excluded is `r mean(stepDay$stepsPerDay, na.rm=T)` and the median is `r median(stepDay$stepsPerDay, na.rm=T)`.

  


```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(stepDay, aes(x=stepsPerDay)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Average number of steps per day") +
  xlab("Number of steps") +
  ylab("Number of days")

```

## The average daily activity pattern

``

```{r}
ggplot(stepInterval, aes(x=interval, y=stepsPerInt)) + 
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Average number of steps per 5 minutes interval") +
  xlab("Interval") +
  ylab("Number of steps")

```



The interval that produced the maximum number of steps across all days was `r maxSteps[1,1]` to `r maxSteps[1,1]+5` minutes, that on average produced `r maxSteps[1,2]` steps.


## Imputing missing values


There are a total of `r length(data$steps)` five minutes intervals in the data set,  covering the number of steps over a period of `r length(levels(data$date))` days (from `r min(as.character(data$date))` to `r max(as.character(data$date))`). Of these values a total of `r sum(is.na(data$steps))` contains missing values (coded as NAs). 

The chosen strategy to handle NAs is to impute values by setting the missing values to the average of the same five minutes interval for the same day of the week in the whole dataset, f.x. if the  first interval (0-5 minutes) for the first Monday contains a NA, then it is replaced with the average for the same interval for all Mondays in the data set.

Compared to the original data, the imputed values rising the mean number of steps per interval slightly (from `r mean(data$steps, na.rm = T)` to `r mean(data$impstep)`), but it doesnÂ´t effect the median that is `r median(data$impstep)`. 

The total number of steps per day on average is `r mean(stepDay$stepsPerDay)`. In the data with imputed values the average is `r mean(stepDayimp$stepsPerDay)`. The median value is `r median(stepDay$stepsPerDay)` and the corresponding median for the imputed values  is `r median(stepDayimp$stepsPerDay)`

A total of `r missingIntervals` five minutes intervals are completly missing in the dataset and their values are not marked as NA. Because they are missing in the data  for every day in the studied period, no messures has been made to impute values to these missing intervals.



```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(stepDayimp, aes(x=stepsPerDay)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Average number of steps per day using imputed values") +
  xlab("Number of steps") +
  ylab("Number of days")

```


## Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends


The number of steps per interval differs depending on if the day is a weekdays or a day in a weekend. As expected the activitys early in the morning are lower in the weekends but after that the number of steps per interval is mostly higher in the weekends. The average number of steps per day in the weekdays is `r totSteps[totSteps$daygrp=="weekday",2]` that can be compared with the average number of steps per day in the weekends, that is `r totSteps[totSteps$daygrp=="weekend",2]`.



```{r}
ggplot(stepDaygrp, aes(x=interval, y=diffSteps)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ daygrp, ncol=1) +
  ggtitle("Average number of steps per five minutes interval in weekdays and weekends, \ndifference from the average number of steps for each interval for all days") +
  xlab("Interval") +
  ylab("Number of steps, differens from average")
